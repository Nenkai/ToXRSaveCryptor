# ToXRSaveCryptor

Tool for decrypting/encrypting saves from Tales of Xillia Remastered.

Saves are located at `%LOCALAPPDATA%low/BANDAI NAMCO Entertainment/Tales of Xillia Remastered/Save`.

## Usage

Drag/drop file.

Or, `ToXRSaveCryptor <decrypt/encrypt> --input <path to file name>`.

NOTE: It checks if it's already decrypted or encrypted, and will offer to do the other way around when drag-dropping. If using the command, it will abort if it's already encrypted/decrypted.
